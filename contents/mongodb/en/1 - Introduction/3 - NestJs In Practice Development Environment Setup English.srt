00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:09,550
‫Hello everyone, and welcome to the Nestjs In practice course in this course we are going to give you

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,330
‫a complete guided tour of the Nestjs framework.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,750
‫Let's get started setting up your development environment.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,860
‫Let's head over to the Angular University GitHub page and from here let's grab the code that we will

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,150
‫need for the course.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,540
‫So if we scroll down, we are going to see here a search box.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:36,460
‫Let's type in simply nestjs and we are going to see here the first entry should be the Nestjs course.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,890
‫Let's now scroll down and confirm that this is indeed the correct repository.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,840
‫Now we are going to grab this code and we are going to install it in your development machine.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,160
‫There are two ways of doing that, either by cloning the GitHub repository or by downloading the branch

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,020
‫that we need as a zip file.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,310
‫So the branch that we need at the start of the course is not the master branch.

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,990
‫The master branch contains the final code at the end of the course.

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,540
‫The branch that you are looking for right now, it's going to be the one dash Start branch.

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,350
‫So this is the initial point of the course that we need to grab.

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,310
‫If you are coding along as we go through the lessons now, we can download this branch here using this

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,350
‫button here, download a zip or if you prefer to use git, we can also clone this repository and switch

18
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,960
‫to the one dash start branch.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,300
‫Now, before installing the lessons code, we need to make sure that you have on your development machine

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,900
‫the latest version of Node, so you should head over to nodejs.org and download the current version

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,540
‫and not the long term support version.

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,330
‫So tools such as the angular CLI tend to work better with the latest version of Node.

23
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,850
‫So once you have node installed on your machine, the only thing that you need is an ID.

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,700
‫However, if you want to conveniently switch between the multiple branches that you will need at the

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,100
‫beginning of each course section, then I also recommend you to install git on your machine.

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,930
‫Git is however optional.

27
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,770
‫You can always download the code as a zip file as we will see.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,500
‫Now, in order to edit the code, we are going to need an integrated development environment or IDE.

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,340
‫This course is going to be filmed using the Webstorm, which is an excellent ID that you can download

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,350
‫here as a free trial.

31
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:37,970
‫If you prefer a free IDE, then you can also use Visual Studio code, which is also an excellent IDE

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,860
‫and it's completely free.

33
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:46,430
‫Either way you will have Node and an IDE ready to go in your development machine.

34
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:52,970
‫Now that we have these essential tools in place, let's switch over here to the Nestjs repository and

35
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,440
‫let's get the code by, for example, cloning the repository.

36
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,130
‫Remember that you can always download it here as a zip file.

37
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:07,010
‫Either way, once you have the code in your machine, we are going to open it with your IDE of choice.

38
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,130
‫So here we have opened the Nestjs course repository using Webstorm.

39
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,470
‫Now if you downloaded the code as a zip file, you already have the correct code version.

40
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:25,220
‫However, if you downloaded the code via git by cloning the repository, then you will need to switch

41
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,840
‫branches at this point.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,860
‫So for that let's open here a terminal that in Webstorm can be opened with Alt 12 and let's do a git

43
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,840
‫branch command to see that indeed we are in the master branch now.

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,970
‫We will need to switch to the one dash start branch and you can do so in the following way.

45
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,020
‫You are going to run the command git checkout one dash start.

46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:55,040
‫Let's now run git branch again and confirm that indeed we are in the one dash start branch containing

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
‫the code that we need at the beginning of the course.

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,490
‫Now, before doing anything else, I recommend that you install all your dependency pieces right now

49
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,900
‫at the beginning of the course.

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,080
‫You can do so here on the folder Nestjs course, which is the root of the repository.

51
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,440
‫You need to make sure that you are in the folder that contains here the root package.json file.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,120
‫And from this folder you are going to run the command NPM install.

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,910
‫Now this is going to take a moment, but all your dependencies that you need for running the small frontend

54
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,220
‫that we are going to be using are going to be installed once your frontend dependencies are installed.

55
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,620
‫I recommend that at this point in the course you install also your backend dependencies.

56
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,290
‫This way you will have all your dependencies installed with the correct version so that we can focus

57
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,680
‫on the development of our API.

58
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,740
‫In order to install the backend dependencies, you need to CD into the rest API folder, which is this

59
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,180
‫directory here that we can see at the root of the repository.

60
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,500
‫So inside this.

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,080
‫Directory, you are going to find a second package.json which corresponds to our back end.

62
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,790
‫So as you can see, this is a separate node project nested inside here, our root repository.

63
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:20,780
‫So from inside this rest folder we are going to run a second NPM install command.

64
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:27,140
‫This is going to pull down all our backend dependencies and with this we have all the correct dependencies

65
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,210
‫installed with the right versions.

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,450
‫Notice that both the back end and the front end dependencies have package lock Json files.

67
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,480
‫It's important that you don't delete these files and that you run the installation using the versions

68
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,520
‫that are specified inside them.

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,720
‫This way you will be sure that everything works during the course.

70
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,780
‫Okay, so we are now almost ready to start.

71
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,460
‫Let's just give a quick test to our front end to see if it's working.

72
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,730
‫So from the root of our project, which should correspond here to the Nestjs course folder.

73
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,690
‫So it's this folder here at the root of your repository.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,230
‫We are going to run the following command NPM start.

75
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,680
‫This is going to start the angular CLI in development mode and the angular development server is going

76
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,400
‫to be serving this small application that you see here on the screen.

77
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,730
‫Now during the course we will review certain parts of this application which is built in Angular, but

78
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,760
‫we are not going to build the application itself.

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,560
‫Instead we are going to focus on building the back end after a moment.

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,500
‫The angular CLI server is going to be serving here.

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,470
‫Our application on Port 4200.

82
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,120
‫Let's have a look at the application.

83
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,520
‫We are going to switch here to a larger window and we are going to see that we have here a login page.

84
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,350
‫Now we will be implementing authentication and authorization later on in the course.

85
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,530
‫Right now we are going to use here the side menu and we are going to navigate here to the courses page.

86
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:04,800
‫Once we click on courses, we are going to see here the all courses page with a loading indicator.

87
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,750
‫Now this is our application for which we are going to build our rest backend using Nestjs and MongoDB.

88
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,710
‫Let's open here the dev tools and see what is going on here.

89
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,770
‫We are going to open here the network tab and we are going to reload our application to see what type

90
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,140
‫of network requests are being made.

91
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:32,760
‫So as you can see, when the page starts up, we are doing here a request to slash API slash courses

92
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,670
‫and we are getting here a timeout, which means that our backend is not yet working.

93
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:45,030
‫So we are going to build this backend step by step and provide here to this screen a list of courses.

94
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:51,450
‫So this very simple slash API slash courses endpoint is going to be the first endpoint that we are going

95
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,540
‫to build in this course in the following few lessons.

96
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,750
‫Now, one last recommendation while taking the course, it's very important that here when you start

97
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:09,390
‫your front end to use the command NPM start, so please don't use NG serve directly because your project

98
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,470
‫will not work.

99
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,010
‫The NG serve command alone will not be sufficient.

100
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,650
‫We also need to pass it some extra configuration options like we see here on the screen.

101
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,810
‫So please always run NPM start while starting your front end server.

102
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,870
‫And with this we are all set up and ready to go.

103
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,970
‫Let's get started writing our first rest Nestjs endpoint.

104
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,970
‫This is coming right up in the next few lessons.
