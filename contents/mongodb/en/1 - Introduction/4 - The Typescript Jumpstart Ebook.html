<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>This course will be in the&nbsp;<strong>Typescript language</strong>, which is closely related to other languages that you are&nbsp;<em>likely already familiar with</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But it that is not the case, we have here a&nbsp;<strong>E-Book aimed at getting you started quickly with the language</strong>, so that you can focus on the Advanced&nbsp;Angular&nbsp;features presented during the course.</p><p>Before starting setting up your development environment, please take a moment to download&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>Typescript Jumpstart Ebook</strong>, that is available together with this video course:</p><p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/angular-university/typescript-ebook/Typescript_Jumpstart_Book_Udemy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click Here To Start Immediate PDF Download</a></p><p>This book covers the&nbsp;<em>Typescript Type System</em>&nbsp;and the multiples&nbsp;<em>Type Definitions,</em>&nbsp;which are the most unique parts of the language that are a bit&nbsp;different from other closely related languages.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: This is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;required reading before continuing&nbsp;the video&nbsp;course.</p><p>This book is in the PDF format and the&nbsp;<strong>code is fully in text and not in images</strong>, so everything is searchable. This format is ideal for taking it to work and using it during your daily development, &nbsp;please enjoy.</p><p><strong>This Book In a Nutshell</strong></p><p>This book is aimed at &nbsp;developers that want to get a&nbsp;<em>deeper understanding of Typescript</em>. If you have been trying to learn or use Typescript and would now like to go deeper into the language and learn how to make the most of its&nbsp;<strong>powerful type system</strong>, then this book is for you.</p><p><strong>What is the core value proposition of this book?</strong></p><p>Sit down in&nbsp;<em>one evening</em>&nbsp;with this book, and learn the&nbsp;<strong>key aspects</strong>&nbsp;of the language and its type system that might take months of experience and long stackoverflow sessions to gather the hard way.</p><p>Become a lot more comfortable using Typescript on a daily basis, learn quickly the fundamentals of the language so that you can focus on other things in your project.</p><p><strong>Why a Fast-track Guide to Typescript?</strong></p><p>Typescript combines many of the best features of&nbsp;<strong>statically-typed&nbsp;</strong>languages, together with some of the best features of&nbsp;<strong>dynamically-typed</strong>&nbsp;languages.</p><p>So this means that if you already know one of the following: Javascript /ES6, Java, C#, Ruby Python, you will notice many&nbsp;<em>overlapping features.</em>&nbsp;So you already know a lot about Typescript, and only really need to learn&nbsp;<strong>what is unique about it.</strong></p><p><strong>A Deceivingly Familiar Language!</strong></p><p>Many times developers can just jump right into the language without any formal training, because the&nbsp;<strong>language looks so familiar</strong>. And this is very often the case in the Angular Ecosystem for example, where we often just start using the language straight away.</p><p>But you might notice that some things just don't work as expected: for example, compiler error messages show up for something that apparently should just work.</p><p>The problem is that the Typescript type system&nbsp;<strong>works in a very different way</strong>&nbsp;than the type systems of the most popular statically typed languages, and there are good reasons for that.</p><p>The familiarity with other languages is a great feature, but that&nbsp;<strong>familiarity alone might not be enough</strong>&nbsp;for a comfortable development experience.</p><p>To get the most out of Typescript, we really need to take a moment to&nbsp;<strong>dive deeper into its type system</strong>, and that is what this book is specifically about.</p><p><strong>I'm a Javascript Developer, is this book for me?</strong></p><p>If you are afraid that using Typescript means a lot of ceremony and verbosity for just a bit of tooling, in this book you will learn that we can actually have the&nbsp;<strong>best of both worlds in Typescript</strong>:</p><p>we can write very concise code with almost no type annotations, but still benefit from all the tooling like auto-completion and refactoring working out-of-the-box.</p><p><strong>Table Of Contents</strong></p><p>Have a look at the table of contents below, to give you an idea about the book:</p><ul><li><p>Section 1 - Introduction</p></li><li><p>Section 2 - The Typescript Type System</p></li><li><p>A Simple Example - Why Doesn't This Work?</p></li><li><p>Key Concept 1 - Type Inference</p></li><li><p>Key Concept 2</p></li><li><p>Structural SubTyping - How are types defined?</p></li><li><p>Key Concept 3 - Type Compatibility Section</p></li><li><p>Section 3 - Typescript Type Definition</p></li><li><p>What are the multiple scenarios for Typescript Type Definitions?</p></li><li><p>How do I use libraries that don't have Type Definitions available?</p></li><li><p>How does the Any Type work?</p></li><li><p>What is the relation between Type Definitions and Npm?</p></li><li><p>Do we really need type annotations to get type-safety?</p></li><li><p>Why Type safety does not mean more ceremony?</p></li><li><p>The biggest advantage of Typescript</p></li><li><p>How to make the most of Typescript Type Definitions</p></li><li><p>What is @types, when should I use it and why?</p></li><li><p>What happened to the typings executable and DefinitivelyTyped ?</p></li><li><p>What are compiler opt-in types, when should I use them and why?</p></li><li><p>Why do I sometimes get this 'duplicate type definition' error?</p></li><li><p>Handling the gap between libraries and the compiler</p></li><li><p>Guidelines for Using the multiple Type Definitions available</p></li><li><p>How to make sure our programs leverage type safety effectively?</p></li><li><p>Section 4 - Conclusions</p></li><li><p>Final Thoughts</p></li><li><p>Bonus Content - Typescript Video List</p></li><li><p>Bonus Content - Free Angular For Beginners Course</p></li></ul><p>Any questions or feedback about the book?</p><p>If you have&nbsp;<strong>any questions about the book</strong>&nbsp;or would like to send me some&nbsp;<strong>feedback</strong>&nbsp;on it, please send me a Direct Message using the Udemy application.</p><p>I hope you will enjoy this book!&nbsp;</p><p>Kind Regards,&nbsp;</p><p>Vasco</p>
