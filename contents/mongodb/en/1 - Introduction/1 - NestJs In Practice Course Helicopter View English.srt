00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,080
‫Hello everyone, and welcome to the Nestjs in practice course.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,140
‫I'm Vasco from the Angular University and I will be your instructor for this course if you don't know

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,130
‫Nestjs yet.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,290
‫It's like Angular but for the backend.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:24,790
‫So with Nestjs we can design our nodejs backend using a lot of the same concepts that we use also in

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,410
‫our angular frontend.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:34,930
‫So things like modules, pipes, services, ET, all of those concepts we can reuse also to design our

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,250
‫NodeJS backend.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,250
‫Nestjs also has the advantage that it's very similar to some popular backend development frameworks

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,580
‫that you might already know from other ecosystems, such as, for example, the Java Spring framework

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,210
‫from the Java ecosystem or the ASP.Net MVC Framework from the Cdash ecosystem.

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,340
‫Nestjs is very similar to those popular backend development frameworks because it also has an object

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:08,630
‫oriented, decorator based API that allows us to structure our backend by dividing everything into different

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,050
‫types of services such as controllers, repositories.

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:20,120
‫And we can also define our data validation business rules directly on our domain classes using decorators.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,180
‫In this course, you are going to learn from scratch how to design and develop a nestjs backend that

17
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,550
‫is going to take the form of a rest API that queries a MongoDB database.

18
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:38,270
‫So we are going to be using the mongoose ODM or object to document mapping library for querying the

19
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,020
‫database.

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,290
‫If you are not familiar with NoSQL databases or the MongoDB database, please don't worry because we

21
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,720
‫are going to explain everything from scratch.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,320
‫So for this course, no prior knowledge is assumed for Nestjs, MongoDB and Mongoose.

23
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,060
‫In this course we are going to cover in detail the Nestjs backend development framework.

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:06,260
‫We are going to start by providing you with a complete Crud example of data modification and querying

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,380
‫in a MongoDB database using Nestjs.

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,070
‫And then we are going to move on to some more advanced features.

27
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:20,630
‫We are going to add authentication and authorization to our Nestjs backend using Json web tokens.

28
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,780
‫We are going to learn how to design our backend by dividing it into multiple types of services such

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,150
‫as controllers and repositories.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:37,550
‫We are going to learn in detail all the nestjs concepts, including services, modules, guards, pipes.

31
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,480
‫ET cetera.

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,390
‫We are going to learn in detail how to do custom error handling using nestjs and we are also going to

33
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,860
‫learn how to do data validation using a decorator based approach.

34
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,720
‫For that, we are going to be leveraging the built in Nestjs validation pipe.

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,970
‫At the end of this course, you will have learned everything that you need in practice in order to create

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,190
‫a backend using common rest principles, query a MongoDB database design and develop your backend using

37
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,250
‫common patterns such as controllers and services.

38
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,550
‫You will learn how to do decorator based data validation, custom error handling and you will know how

39
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,000
‫to secure your backend using authentication and authorization based on Json web tokens.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,020
‫So you will have learned everything that you need in practice for creating a production ready Nestjs

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,860
‫backend.

42
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,400
‫So I hope that you will enjoy the course.

43
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,210
‫I want to thank you for watching.

44
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,370
‫If you have any questions about the course, please let me know in the comment section below.

45
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,110
‫And without further ado, let's get started learning Nestjs together.
