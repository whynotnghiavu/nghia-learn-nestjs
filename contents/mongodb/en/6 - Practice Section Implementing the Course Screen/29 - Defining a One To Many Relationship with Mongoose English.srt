00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,740
‫Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,820
‫In this lesson, we are going to add a new entity to our program.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,550
‫We are going to configure the lessons entity.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,900
‫We are going to be needing the lessons entity in order to build the view course screen.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,270
‫We are going to be displaying a table that displays a list of lessons belonging to a given course,

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,140
‫and we are going to show how to add pagination logic to that table.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,190
‫So we already have here in our program a lesson entity here in the shared folder at the top level of

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:39,310
‫our project, we have here the shared folder and we have here the file lesson containing the definition

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,990
‫of our lesson entity.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,200
‫As we can see, the lesson has a description, a duration.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,830
‫It is linked to a course and it has a sequential number.

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:53,200
‫So we have here an example of a one to many relation between two entities.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,540
‫A course can have many lessons, and a lesson belongs only to one course.

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,660
‫Let's see, how can we model this relationship in MongoDB?

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,250
‫The first thing that we are going to need is to define a schema for this entity.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,880
‫Here on the Schemas folder, we are going to be creating a new file called Lessons Dot Schema, Dot

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,510
‫TS.

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,740
‫And inside it we are going to define the schema for the lesson entity.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,740
‫Let's start by importing here Mongoose and let's define here the lesson schema.

20
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:31,220
‫We are going to create here a new mongoose schema and let's pass it a configuration object.

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,460
‫Now I'm going to add here quickly the configuration for the description, the duration and the sequential

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,610
‫number, because it's very similar to what we have configured before for the courses entity.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,210
‫Now here we are going to do step by step the configuration of the one to many relationship with the

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,560
‫courses entity.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,630
‫We are going to say that each lesson has a new property which is a course.

26
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,820
‫Now this course is going to be a reference to another MongoDB collection.

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,680
‫Let's have a look at what this type of relationship looks like at the level of the database.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,380
‫So switching here to our MongoDB console, we are going to open here the lessons collection.

29
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,070
‫And here we are going to see that each lesson has a course property.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,780
‫Now the course property is a MongoDB object identifier that links this property to another document

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,310
‫in the courses collection.

32
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,730
‫So, for example, this identifier here is going to correspond to a course here in the courses collection.

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,710
‫And this in general is how we do a one to many relationship in MongoDB.

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,840
‫We are going to be using an object ID to link to a document in another collection.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,440
‫Let's then see how can we define this relationship in mongoose?

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,140
‫So we have here a property called course.

37
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,700
‫Let's define the type.

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,510
‫The type is going to be a MongoDB object identifier.

39
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:00,530
‫So let's define it here using Mongoose, we are going to access here the schema type definitions and

40
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,830
‫here we are going to choose the object ID type.

41
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,660
‫Now we are going to say that this property course is a reference to another collection.

42
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,580
‫Let's specify here the name of the link entity, which will be a course.

43
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,730
‫And with this we have defined our new lesson schema.

44
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,980
‫Let's now plug it into Mongoose.

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,710
‫So here in the definition of our courses module, we are going to be adding here a new configuration

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,460
‫object.

47
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:33,290
‫Let's define here that the lesson entity is defined by this lesson schema that we have just created.

48
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,230
‫And with this in place, our program is now ready to query also the lessons collection and we will be

49
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,280
‫using that functionality to implement the search lessons endpoint.
