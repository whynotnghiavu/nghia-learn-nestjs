00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,920
‫Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,380
‫In this new lesson, we are going to set up our new MongoDB database.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,490
‫Now, we could install MongoDB locally in your development machine, but I think it's going to be a

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,240
‫lot easier if you use instead a cloud service.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,260
‫So for that we are going to switch here to Mongodb.com and we are going to register to its cloud service.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,270
‫So this will give you access to a free database that you can use for learning purposes.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,910
‫Let's then hit here the sign in button and let's register with a new account.

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,060
‫If you already have a username, you can go ahead and log in.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,210
‫Otherwise we are going to click here on register.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,590
‫Now you need to fill in these details and then click here on Continue.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,990
‫Once you have set up your account, you are going to be asked what type of database cluster do you need?

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,360
‫You are going to choose the free cluster that we are going to be using for learning purposes.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,520
‫From here you are going to be choosing your cloud provider and region and you can use the defaults as

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,440
‫they will work well for the course.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,190
‫Once you have selected the defaults, let's click on Create Cluster.

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,860
‫Notice that your cluster is still being created.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,810
‫We can see that this should take around ten minutes while the cluster is being created.

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,300
‫We are going to create a database user.

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,070
‫We are going to grant access to our development machine while the cluster is building.

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,990
‫Let's go ahead and continue here.

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,580
‫The initialization process.

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,580
‫We are going to create our first database user.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,900
‫We can do so by clicking here on security database access.

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,530
‫And from here we are going to create our first database user.

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,440
‫Notice that this is not an end user like, for example, a person that connects to your application

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,220
‫and uses it.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,560
‫This is an administrative user.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,010
‫So these users are typically either database administrators or applications that need to access the

29
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,050
‫database in write mode.

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,150
‫Let's then create a new administrative user, let's call it Nestjs dash admin.

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,770
‫So that is the user name.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,360
‫And let's enter a password by clicking on Autogenerate secure password.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,690
‫We are going to make this user a Atlas admin.

34
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,780
‫So Atlas is the MongoDB Cloud service.

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,560
‫Let's click now on Add User and this has created here our first user.

36
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,020
‫The next step is to whitelist our IP address.

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,430
‫So what is this?

38
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,000
‫Our server is going to be running in a given address.

39
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,880
‫We want to make sure that the database accepts queries incoming from this address.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,250
‫So it's an extra security protection that the database offers us in production.

41
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,220
‫You not only want to authenticate the username and password of the administrative user, but you also

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,730
‫want to whitelist the address from which the query is coming from in case that the password gets lost.

43
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,200
‫Let's then click here on Whitelist IP address and let's now click on Security Network Access.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,770
‫We are now going to click here on Add IP address and we are going to choose the option for the particular

45
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,670
‫case of our course because we are simply using this for learning purposes.

46
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,270
‫We are going to choose the option, allow access from anywhere.

47
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,150
‫So this is not recommended in production.

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,060
‫In production, you should have a static IP address for your production server and you should add only

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,730
‫that specific IP address to the white list.

50
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,580
‫Let's click here on confirm and we are going to see that this white list request is still on status

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:38,210
‫pending, so we are going to wait for a few minutes while MongoDB sets up our database cluster.

52
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,410
‫After a moment, the white listing of the IP address should be completed.

53
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,020
‫So if we now click here for example, on clusters, we are going to see what is the current state of

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,950
‫our cluster.

55
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,600
‫It seems to be up and running.

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,550
‫Let's click here on collections.

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:59,990
‫Collections are like database tables in SQL databases, so collections are going to be groups of related

58
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,520
‫documents in MongoDB.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,550
‫So MongoDB is a document database.

60
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,960
‫We are going to be talking a lot more about collections and documents throughout the course.

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,580
‫Right now, let's simply add some data to the database and see what it looks like.
