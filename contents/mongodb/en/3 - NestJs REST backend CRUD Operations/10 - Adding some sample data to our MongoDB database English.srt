00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,880
‫Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,520
‫In the last lesson, we have set up our MongoDB database.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,410
‫What we're going to do now is we are going to fill it in with some sample data that we are then going

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,680
‫to be querying from our Nestjs endpoint.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,260
‫So for populating the database, we are going to be using a small script that we already have prepared

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,300
‫and we are going to be inserting this same data that we have been displaying here on the screen, which

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,000
‫is coming from the DB data file.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,300
‫So in order to upload this data directly to MongoDB, we are going to need the script that is available

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,790
‫here under the rest API folder.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,960
‫We will see here a file called Populate DB Dot TS.

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:50,800
‫This is going to contain our database population script that we will need to insert our data into the

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,610
‫database.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:59,170
‫Now this is a very simple script that uses the MongoDB client API for inserting the data in the database.

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,700
‫You will find here some instructions on how to use this script, but it's actually very simple.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,580
‫You are going to need to build here a connection URL string and you are going to replace it here on

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,510
‫this constant.

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,880
‫Let's see how we are going to build this string.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,060
‫We are going to switch over here to the MongoDB console and we are going to click here on clusters.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,850
‫From here we are going to click on the button Connect and here we are going to choose one of multiple

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,280
‫methods for connecting to the database.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,830
‫Let's click here on Connect Your Application and from here we are going to see the connection string

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,820
‫that we are going to need.

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,870
‫So as you can see, we have here a URL that has the username that we want to use in this case Nestjs

24
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,320
‫Dash admin, which is our only administrator user.

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,720
‫We need to put in here our password.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,900
‫So we need to put the password after the colon sign and before the at sign.

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,570
‫So we need to delete this angle brackets.

28
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,040
‫Otherwise this will not work.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,180
‫And here we have the cluster name and a couple more options.

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,840
‫So let's copy this string and let's paste it here.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,220
‫In our workspace, we are going to replace this MongoDB connection with the string that we got here

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,960
‫from the MongoDB console.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,070
‫So we have here the correct username Nestjs dash admin.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:27,020
‫We now need to delete here the password and the angle brackets that we saw there and fill in here the

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,920
‫password between the colon and the at sign.

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,000
‫So you can see here an example of how to fill this in.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,430
‫And as you can see, the password is here between the colon and the at sign without any further characters

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,270
‫in between.

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,150
‫So please go ahead and fill in your password here.

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,750
‫Let's say that your password would be test one, two, three.

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,650
‫Then this is how your connection string would look like.

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,140
‫If by some reason you forgot your password, you can always change it by switching here to the MongoDB

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,770
‫console.

44
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,380
‫We are going to go ahead and click here on database Access and we can select here the user that we have

45
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,540
‫created, Nestjs Dash Admin.

46
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,620
‫We click here on edit and we can change the password using here.

47
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,760
‫Edit Password.

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,730
‫Notice that when you click edit password, you can autogenerate here a secure password and if you want

49
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,400
‫to see it, you need to click here on show.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,240
‫So this is not the password that I will be using throughout the course.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,830
‫It's just an example.

52
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,500
‫Once you have your password set up, we are going to click now on Cancel and we are now going to go

53
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,960
‫back to our workspace and we are going to run the database population script.

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,550
‫Everything is ready to go.

55
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,490
‫So from the rest API folder that you need to make sure that you are in, you are going to be running

56
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,690
‫the following command NPM run populate dash DB.

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,250
‫Let's hit enter.

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,050
‫After a while this command is going to start inserting some data on the database.

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,950
‫We can see here the different type of data that is getting inserted.

60
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,050
‫We can see the courses and the lessons.

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,810
‫We see some of the IDs getting generated.

62
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,900
‫And this should only take a moment at the end.

63
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,090
‫We are going to be creating here some indexes and the process will exit successfully.

64
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,280
‫So if we now switch back here to the MongoDB console, we are going to see the data by clicking here

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,300
‫on clusters.

66
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,510
‫And from there we are going to click on collections.

67
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,910
‫As we can see now, we have here a Nestjs course database with two collections in it.

68
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,930
‫We have here the courses collection and we have the lessons collection.

69
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,100
‫So a collection is a group of related documents.

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,720
‫We can see here the courses.

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,170
‫So as you can see, they all have more or less the same fields.

72
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,320
‫We have an ID for each course, which is unique.

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,690
‫We have the description, a long description.

74
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,410
‫ET cetera.

75
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,050
‫And the same thing goes for lessons.

76
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,440
‫So each lesson has its own unique identifier, which is this object ID that we will be talking more

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,820
‫throughout the course.

78
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,500
‫We have also here some data.

79
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,880
‫Fields such as the description, the duration, etcetera.

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,480
‫And we have the course to which the lesson belongs to.

81
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:13,810
‫We can see here, for example, that this lesson document belongs to the course with this particular

82
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,260
‫ID.

83
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,490
‫So this is how in mongodb we do a one to many relation.

84
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,120
‫Its by using this object identifiers that we see here.

85
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,010
‫Again, more on this later.

86
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:31,030
‫Right now as we have data here ready to go in our database, we are now going to see how can we query

87
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,300
‫this data from our nestjs process.

88
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,970
‫Again, throughout the course we are going to be talking about documents, collections, how they relate

89
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,050
‫together, how can we link a document to another collection, etcetera.

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,230
‫All of that will be covered later on during the course.
