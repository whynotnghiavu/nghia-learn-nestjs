1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,462
Commands query
responsibility segregation.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,430
Or shorthand secure us.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,470
Is a software architectural pattern that
separates the concerns of reading data

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,310
queries

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,450
and writing data

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,890
commands into separate models.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,740
The core idea behind
secure us as to have

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,220
different models and
approaches for handling read.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,070
And write operations in a system

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,260
rather than combining
them into a single model.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,110
In traditional architectures
and crud systems.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,070
The same model is often used to
handle both read and write operations.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,350
However

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,700
as applications
grow and complexity.

15
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,322
Requirements for reading and writing
data can diverge signify currently.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,870
This can lead to issues related to
performance scalability and maintain ability.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,540
With seek your s the applications data
model is divided into two separate parts.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,150
The command model which handles
write operations aka data modification.

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,120
This model enforces business
rules and validation logic

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,930
to ensure that data changes
are correct inconsistent.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,710
And the second
being the query model.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,830
Which handles read
operations a gay data retrieval.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,670
The query model is
optimized for reading data

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,530
and often involves d
normalized data structures or

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,760
specialized views that cater
to specific read use cases.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,060
This separation allows
for efficient querying in

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,390
improves the overall
performance of the read operations.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,520
The secure as approach
offers several benefits such as.

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
Performance.

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,890
It allows us to optimize the read
and write operations independently

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,880
for example.

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,060
We can use different data stores
for the read and write models.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,690
This allows us to choose
the right tool for the job

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,720
and optimize the data stores
for their specific use cases.

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
Scale ability.

36
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,520
Secure us lets us scaled the read and write
operations independently for example a

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,770
nice use case is a
flight booking system.

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,890
Where the read operations
are much much more frequent

39
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,670
than the right operations.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,070
And lastly.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Maintainability.

42
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,650
Secure us allows us to evolve the read
and write my models independently as well.

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,260
However

44
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,720
like anything else in
the engineering world

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,810
seek you are s also comes
with some drawbacks such as.

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Complexity.

47
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,950
Secure as certainly adds an additional
complexity to a system making it harder to

48
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,170
understand and not suited
for simple applications.

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,510
And also

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,200
eventual consistency.

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,100
The read and write models are
typically eventually consistent.

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,370
Meaning that the changes
made to the right model

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,980
are usually not immediately
reflected in the read model.

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,010
While this isn't a
drawback for say.

55
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,920
It's something that we he'd be
aware of when using secure us.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,720
Seek you r s is also used in
combination with event sourcing

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,590
and event driven architectures.

58
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,070
Both of which will dive
deeper into in future lessons.

59
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,980
In the next lesson

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,720
will take a look at
how we can implement

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,050
you

62
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,190
us in our very an application.

63
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,020
Let's get started.
