1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,250
Before we kicked things off.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,300
Let's start by generating an empty nest
Jess application just so we have something

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,740
that we can work with
for the following lessons.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,572
Etc to our terminals

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,600
and enter in the
nest new command

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,870
calling our a project advanced
architecture or whatever you wish.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,080
Once everything
finishes installing.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's cd or change directory
into our newly created

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,110
application by entering cd
advanced dash architecture.

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,260
With our initial start or and place let's
generate a single resource with nest g

11
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:35,010
resource that we will
call alarms just we have

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,010
something to operate
on throughout the course.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,340
Will use the autogen
operated module

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,320
service and controller
and future lessons.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,080
Great.

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,430
While that in place we
can now start our application

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,696
in development mode with
n p m run start Colin deaf.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,870
And as always

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,660
our application will now be
available on port three thousand.

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,040
And so there we have it

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,740
now with our basic app set up we're
ready to continue moving forward.
