1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,220
Before we kick things off let's start off
by generating an empty nest js application

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,710
just the we have something we
can work with in the following lessons.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,050
Let's head over
to our terminals.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,510
In enter into the
nest new command.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,330
Calling our project
advanced dash concepts

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080
or whatever you wish.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,480
Once everything
finishes installing.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,510
Let's cd or change directory into our
newly created application by entering cd

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,621
advanced dash concepts.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,790
With our initial
starter in place

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,050
let's generate a
single resource.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,200
With nest g resource
that we will call coffees.

13
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:38,350
Miss the we have something to
operate on throughout the course.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,300
Will use the auto generated module
service and controller in future lessons.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,860
Great.

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,640
With all the some place
we can now start our

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,690
application in development
mode owed with n p m run

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,620
start Colin depth.

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,280
As always our application will now
be available on port three thousand

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,180
and there we have it

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,770
were all set to continue
moving forward.
