knowledge wise of the

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,980
Before you start watching this course
we recommend taking a step back

26
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,280
and checking out the
official fundamentals

27
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,520
course if you're not
already comfortable with

28
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,300
yes that is.

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,920
In this extension will assume that you're
familiar with everything we've covered in

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,540
the fundamentals
call source however

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,470
we will be starting this course
with a new application from

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,940
scratch to make sure we
don't have any redundant files.

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,580
This will make it easier
to holistically understand

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,730
what's needed to implement
authentication in our nest js projects.
