00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,750
Authentication and authorization
while often used interchangeably

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,540
represent essentially
different functions.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,470
Authentication is the
process of identifying users

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,630
invalidating who
they claim to be.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,500
One of the most standard an
obvious factors to authenticate identity

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,890
as a password.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,450
If the user matches the password
credentials him means the identity is valid

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,910
and the system grants
access to that user.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,790
This entire face is usually
done before authorization.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,460
Let's put things in terms
of our coffee application

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,120
that we've been building
in all of the nastiest courses.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,820
As a more real world
example of authentication.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,080
Let's say a user wants to view
a list of their favorite coffees

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,010
but to do so

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,840
they would need to sign in first

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,350
that they can be properly identified by
the system before seeing their favorites.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,790
Authorization on the other hand
is the process of giving a user

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,610
permission to access a
specific resource or function.

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,440
Or example in administrative
user may be allowed to create

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,150
edit and delete coffees

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,610
whereas a non
administrative user

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,320
is only authorized
to view coffees.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Authorization

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,590
as orthogonal

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,390
meaning that it is
independent of authentication

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,160
however

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,550
authorization does require
an authentication mechanism

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,570
in order to function properly.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,810
On the current slide
you can see a nice simple

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,810
comparison between
authentication and authorization.

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,260
Don't worry if it doesn't
make much sense yet.

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,000
In this course extension will be implementing
both of these mechanisms step by step.

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,670
To let's get started and
set up everything we need

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,500
in terms of authentication
and authorization.

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,060
All completely from scratch
without using any third party off libs.

36
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,840
All industrious.
