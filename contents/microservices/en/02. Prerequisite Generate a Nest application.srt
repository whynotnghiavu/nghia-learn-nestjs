1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,070
Before we kick things off.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's start by generating an empty nest as
application just so we have something we

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,410
can work with in
the following lessons.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,810
Let's head over to our terminals

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,030
and entering the
nest new command.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,820
Calling our project
virtual dash facility

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,810
or whatever you wish.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,240
Once everything
finishes installing

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,950
let's cd or change directory into our
newly created application in our case by

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,685
entering cd virtual
dashed facility.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,510
With our initial starter
and place we can

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,810
now start or application
in development mode

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,190
with n p m run

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,090
start colon depth.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,130
As always

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,430
our application will now be
available on port three thousand

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,660
and there we have it

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,880
were all set and ready to
continue moving forward.
